üìö Overview

This repository, Algorithms & Data Structures, is my personal workspace for learning and quickly testing fundamental computer science concepts. While primarily built for my own practice, feel free to use it if it helps you too! It's designed to strengthen understanding of both Git version control and core algorithms and data structures in Java.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git installed on your system
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Explore the implementations:**
   - Browse through different data structure folders
   - Run individual java classes (Main) in each folder

3. **Practice with Git:**
   - Create feature branches for new implementations
   - Make meaningful commits with clear messages
   - Practice merging and resolving conflicts
