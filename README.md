# AlgoDS - Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

---

## 📚 Overview

**AlgoDS** is a comprehensive collection of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** implementations, designed as a hands-on learning project. This repository serves as both a practice ground for mastering essential CS concepts and a demonstration of proper software development practices.

**Main Goals:**
- Master core data structures and algorithmic concepts through implementation
- Practice **Git version control** workflows and best practices  
- Develop clean, well-documented code structure
- Build a solid foundation for technical interviews and advanced programming
